# Data Analysis and Visualization with Python

## Overview
This project demonstrates data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Python. The project includes scripts for web scraping, data transformation using SQL, and creating detailed reports.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
- `scripts/`: Contains Python scripts for data cleaning, visualization, and web scraping.
- `reports/`: Contains the final reports in PDF and PPTX formats.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh

    cd data-analysis-project
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the data cleaning script:
